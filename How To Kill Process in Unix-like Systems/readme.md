# How To Kill Process in Unix-like Systems

## Introduction

In Unix-like systems, you can dynamically kill multiple processes based on certain criteria, such as process name, using a combination of commands and tools available in the terminal. This readme provides an approach to identify, extract, and terminate processes based on specified criteria.

## Approach

### 1. Identify Processes

Use the `ps aux` command to list all processes. You can then filter this list based on criteria such as process name using tools like `grep`.

For example, to list all processes containing the name "lsphp", you can use:

```bash
ps aux | grep 'lsphp'
```

### 2. Extract Process IDs (PIDs)

After filtering processes based on your criteria, extract the PIDs from the filtered list using tools like `awk`.

For example, to extract the PIDs from the filtered list of processes containing "lsphp", you can use:

```bash
ps aux | grep 'lsphp' | awk '{print $2}'
```

This command prints only the second field from each line of the filtered output, which represents the PID of each process.

### 3. Kill Processes

Once you have the list of PIDs, use the `xargs` command to pass them as arguments to the `kill` command, which will terminate each specified process.

For example, to kill all processes containing the name "lsphp", you can combine the previous commands as follows:

```bash
ps aux | grep 'lsphp' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
```

This approach dynamically filters processes based on your criteria (in this case, the process name), extracts their PIDs, and then terminates them. You can adjust the filtering criteria as needed to target specific processes.

## Caution

Please exercise caution when using such commands, especially in production environments, as terminating processes can have unintended consequences. Always ensure that you're targeting the correct processes and consider the potential impact on your system before proceeding.
